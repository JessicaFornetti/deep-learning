This project is divided into 2 main tasks:

- Task 1: Song Genre Prediction
- Task 2: Image Classification Using Transfer Learning

# Project Overview
This repository contains 3 notebooks, one for [task 1](Deep Leaning - Task 1 - Song Genre Prediction.ipynb), [task 2](Deep Learning - Task 2 - Image Classification Using Transfer Learning.ipynb) and a [demo notebook](Demo Notebook.ipynb) to test out the saved models on the test set. A [pdf report](Deep Learning Report.pdf) presents a comparaison of the different results and an analysis of the results.
