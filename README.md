# deep-learning

This project is divided into 2 main tasks:

- Task 1: Song Genre Prediction
- Task 2: Image Classification Using Transfer Learning

# Project Overview
This repository contains 3 notebooks, one for [task 1](Deep%20Leaning%20-%20Task%201%20-%20Song%20Genre%20Prediction.ipynb), [task 2](Deep%20Learning%20-%20Task%202%20-%20Image%20Classification%20Using%20Transfer%20Learning.ipynb) and a [demo notebook](Demo%20Notebook.ipynb) to test out the saved models on the test set. A [pdf report](Deep%20Learning%20Report.pdf) presents a comparaison of the different results and their analysis.
